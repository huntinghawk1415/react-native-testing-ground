# React Native Flashcard App

## Before getting started:

Due to a blunder with React-Native, you should have Yarn installed on your system. [Click here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/ "Get Yarn") to install it. If you'd like to use NPM, you would have to use v4 or below.

In terms of viewing, this app was created for Android (sorry iOS lovers). If you don't have an Android, you can download an Android emulator. I personally recommend [BlueStacks](https://bluestacks.com/ "Get BlueStacks").

And finally, this app was tested primarily in the BlueStacks Android emulator and occasionally on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge device. The latter failed to show the loading animation provided by React-Native, so be weary of that if that's what you're testing on.

## To get started:

* Make sure you have Expo downloaded on your device/emulator

* Install all dependencies
    - `yarn install`

* Start the app
    - `cd playground; yarn start`

* Once the app has booted, use Expo's QC code or link (from the terminal) to view the app
